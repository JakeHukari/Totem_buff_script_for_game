# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains **SP3ARBR3AK3R** - a totem power system for a competitive game. This is a core game mechanic where players compete to acquire a mystical totem that grants temporary tactical advantages.

**Critical Context:** This is an intentional game feature for a game created by this development team. The powerful detection/tracking capabilities are deliberate design choices to reward players who spend 1-2+ hours competing for the totem. See DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.md for full design rationale.

## Code Structure

### Main Files
- `SP3ARBR3AK3R_v3.lua` - The complete totem power system implementation (632 lines)
- `DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.md` - Essential design documentation explaining the system's purpose and balance

### Architecture (Lua/Roblox)

The system is built as a Roblox Lua script with these core components:

**Services Layer** (lines 160-167)
- Uses Roblox services: Players, RunService, UserInputService, Workspace, Lighting, etc.
- Manages game state and player interactions

**Configuration System** (lines 106-155)
- `CONFIG` table contains all tunable parameters
- Organized by category: AutoClick, ESP, Visual, Detection, Raycast, UI
- Modern theme system with professional color palette (v3.0)

**State Management**
- Feature toggles: `ESP_ENABLED`, `CLICKBREAK_ENABLED`, `AUTOCLICK_ENABLED`, `SKY_MODE_ENABLED`
- Per-player tracking via `perPlayer` table
- Connection tracking for cleanup via `connections` array

**UI System** (lines 292-486)
- Modern panel-based interface (v3.0 redesign)
- Three main panels: Threat Monitor, Controls, Totem History
- Radar display in bottom-right
- Professional color palette with muted grays and subtle accents

**Update Loop** (lines 546-579)
- Heartbeat-based main loop with delta time
- Throttled updates using `runUpdate()` helper
- Efficient player proximity detection
- Real-time threat display updates

**Keyboard Controls** (lines 489-543)
- Ctrl+E: Toggle ESP
- Ctrl+C: Toggle AutoClick
- Ctrl+L: Toggle Sky Mode
- Ctrl+H: Toggle UI visibility
- Ctrl+6: Full system shutdown
- Dispatch table pattern for O(1) keybind lookup

## Development Workflow

### Testing the Script

Since this is a Roblox Lua script, testing requires the Roblox Studio environment:

1. Open Roblox Studio
2. Load your game project
3. Insert the script into StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts or ServerScriptService
4. Run the game in Studio (F5)
5. Test totem acquisition and power activation

### Making Changes

**Configuration Changes:**
- Modify values in the `CONFIG` table (lines 106-155)
- No code changes needed for balance adjustments
- Example: Adjust `AUTOCLICK_CPS`, `ESP_THREAT_RANGE`, `RADAR_SIZE`

**UI/Visual Changes:**
- Color palette defined in `COLORS` table (lines 180-205)
- Panel creation via `createPanel()` helper (lines 299-341)
- Modern styling with corner radius and borders

**Feature Toggles:**
- Default states set in lines 172-175
- Runtime toggles via keyboard shortcuts or UI buttons

### Code Organization Patterns

**Connection Management:**
- All event connections tracked via `bind()` function
- Cleanup via `disconnectAll()` ensures no memory leaks
- Critical for script reload/shutdown

**Update Throttling:**
- `updateCounter` and `updateIntervals` tables control update frequency
- `runUpdate(dt, name)` helper prevents over-updating
- Different rates for: nearest detection, visual updates, culling, radar, cleanup

**Debouncing:**
- Toggle debouncing via `canToggle()` prevents rapid key spam
- Default debounce time: 0.15s

## Key Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations (v3.0)

- Disabled animations (`ENABLE_ANIMATIONS = false`)
- Disabled glow effects for cleaner look
- Distance calculations use squared distances to avoid sqrt
- Update throttling reduces unnecessary processing
- Efficient dispatch tables for keybinds

### Safety Patterns

- `safeDestroy()` wrapper for safe object cleanup
- `pcall()` protection around risky operations
- Dead state check prevents execution after shutdown
- Game process input guard (`gp` parameter) prevents double-input

### State Lifecycle

1. **Initialization** (lines 584-614)
   - Validates all UI components exist
   - Checks service availability
   - Sets up character respawn handling

2. **Runtime**
   - Heartbeat loop processes game state
   - Keyboard input handlers respond to controls
   - UI updates reflect system status

3. **Cleanup** (lines 617-622)
   - `game:BindToClose()` ensures proper shutdown
   - Disconnects all event listeners
   - Destroys UI elements

## Design Philosophy

### Why Powers Are Strong

The totem grants powerful detection/tracking because:
- Players compete 1-2+ hours to acquire it
- Weak powers wouldn't justify the competition
- The strength creates ongoing competitive loops
- Built-in counterplay exists (visibility, targeting, teamwork)

This is intentional game design, not a bug or exploit.

### Version History Context

- **v2.5**: Neon-themed UI with heavy animations
- **v3.0** (current): Professional UI redesign
  - 40-50% GPU/CPU performance improvement
  - Removed bounce/pulse effects
  - Muted color palette
  - Same core functionality

## Important Notes

### When Modifying Code

1. **Preserve the competitive balance** - Changes should maintain the totem's desirability
2. **Test in full game context** - Powers are balanced for 1-2 hour competition cycles
3. **Update DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.md** - Keep design rationale documentation current
4. **Performance matters** - This runs continuously while totem is held

### Common Modification Scenarios

**Adjusting Power Strength:**
- Modify `CONFIG` values for detection ranges, update frequencies
- Consider impact on competition incentive
- Consult design team before major changes

**UI Customization:**
- Edit `COLORS` table for theme changes
- Adjust panel positions/sizes in createPanel() calls
- Maintain readability during gameplay

**Adding New Features:**
- Follow existing patterns (toggles, debouncing, cleanup tracking)
- Add to keyboard dispatch table if adding keybinds
- Document in header comments
